== Kontagent Python Client Library ==

Please see help(kontagent) for documentation.

For generic use of the Kontagent Analytics API, the AnalyticsInterface
class is what you need to use.

Please see:
http://developers.kontagent.com/reference/api-documentation/facebook-rest-server-api
for detailed information on the parameters needed for each call to the API.

== Django ==

If you are using Django, the middleware is:
'kontagent.middleware.KontagentMiddleware'

You need these settings in your settings.py:

FACEBOOK_APP_NAME = "yourapp"
FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_HOST = "http://your-server.ca:10000"
FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_PATH = "/fb/canvas/"
KONTAGENT_API_SERVER = "api.test.kontagent.net"
KONTAGENT_API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_HOST + FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_PATH should be the
same as what you entered as your app's callback in the facebook
developers app.

FACEBOOK_APP_NAME should be what you entered as your app name.

If you are using pyfacebook, include the Kontagent middleware before
the pyfacebook middleware (pyfacebook may redirect in certain casses
and strip necessary tracking parameters from the URL).
